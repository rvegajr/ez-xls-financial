# EzXlsFinancial - Easy Excel Financial Objects

A project that I am working on requires the value for NPV to be exactly what excel gives.   Me and my colleague spent days using whatever library we could. 
We understand how the algorthim works and used all sorts of sample code and still we could not get the numbers to line up.  This project is patterned in a way that should
make it easy to create objects to use every bit of excel formulas.  Basically we write to columns, set the formulas,  cause a recalc,  read the number we need, profit?
